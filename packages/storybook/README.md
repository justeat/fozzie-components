#Intro
Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.

Storybook runs outside of your app. This allows you to develop UI components in isolation, which can improve component reuse, testability, and development speed. You can build quickly without having to worry about application-specific dependencies.

#Usage

### Storybook story file location
`packages/f-<component-name>/stories/*.stories.js`

### Running Storybook locally
`yarn storybook:deploy`
