## Usage

### Installation

Install the module using NPM or Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @justeat/f-form-field
```

```sh
npm install @justeat/f-form-field
```

### Vue Applications

You can import it in your Vue SFC like this (please note that styles have to be imported separately):

```js
import FormField from '@justeat/f-form-field';
import '@justeat/f-form-field/dist/f-form-field.css';

export default {
    components: {
        FormField
    }
}
```

If you are using Webpack, you can import the component dynamically to separate the `mega-modal` bundle from the main `bundle.client.js`:

```js
import '@justeat/f-form-field/dist/f-form-field.css';

export default {
    components: {
        // â€¦
        FormField: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "form-field" */ '@justeat/f-form-field')
    }
}
```
