# f-development-context
> This is not an NPM module, it is a collection of context files for development purposes (Storybook) and testing purposes (Web Driver).

- The purpose of this directory is to house shared files which setup the context in the right way for development and testing
- CoreWeb and other microsites are responsible for setting up the context when components are implemented by them.
